# Chiisai URL
This application is a replica of [tinyurl] (https://tinyurl.com/) built in React, Express, Node, and SQL.
It takes in a URL and returns a shortened URL that routes to the same website and counts everytime a shortened URL is visited.
This app uses user authentication and only allows users to view URLs that they've created.
