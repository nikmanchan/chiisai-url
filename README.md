# Chiisai URL
This application is a replica of [tinyurl](https://tinyurl.com/) built in React, Express, Node, and SQL.
It takes in a URL and returns a shortened URL that routes to the same website and counts everytime a shortened URL is visited.
This app uses user authentication and only allows users to view URLs that they've created.

## Getting Started
Clone down repository using https://github.com/nikmanchan/chiisai-url.git.

Run "npm install" after cloning the repository locally.

Run "npm run client" in one command line window to start-up client.

Run "npm run server" in another command line window to start-up server.

Connect to local PostgreSQL server at Port: 5432.

Create a database named "chiisai_url" and run SQL queries in database.sql file in sequential order from the top.

The app will now be available locally.

### Demo
